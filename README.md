This is Raspberry pi Python code for displaying bitcoin price on LED display
This code is for a Raspberry pi that will illustrate the price of bitcoin at the moment. The project was led by four high school students for class using python. The high school students names are Andy, Oliver, Andres, and Isa. This is what they each did:
Andy designed the surrounding casing for the LED board with the laser cutter provided by the school. He also helped set up the monitor, keyboard and mouse. Oliver wrote and API and worked alongside with Andres by controlling the Raspberry Pi. Andres was busy finding code as a reference for the LED Panel. Lastly, Isa worked on the Github and anything else that the group needed.
